Changed the page layout 
- Changed the name on the page from basic MVC name to my    name of the app

- Changed Html action links. An Html action link creates    a button on the page that changes the current page. For example, by default    you start on the home page, and if you click on students, then the page will    change and all the students will be shown.

Installed Entity Framework 
- self explanatory

Implemented Models 
- Added a class for each type of entity in my application called models. They define an entity like game or reviewer is.

Implemented Context and Initializer 
- The main class that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a given data model is the database context class - in my case SearchAppContext.

-The modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove statement in the OnModelCreating method prevents table names from being pluralized. If you didn't do this, the generated tables in the database would be named Developers, Clients, and Games. Instead, the table names will be Developer, Client, and Game

- The AppInitializer class creates a database only if it doesn't exist (and throw an exception if the model has changed and the database already exists).

-Changes in Web.config tell Entity Framework to use AppInitializer

Implemented Controllers and fixed errors
-Fixed the names in _Layout.cshtml

-Created controllers and views. The controllers and views work together. For example, when you click the student button on the page, the controller takes the list of students from SearchAppContext and the view displays it. They can perform various operations, but the concept is the same.

Changed app to .net core and added authentification

- Changed app to .net core(removed old project)
- relevant files(edited by me) : - startup.cs
				 - controllers folder
				 - _Layout.cshtml
	


-startup.cs
Creates user roles and "connects" them to the user(edits database tables aspnetroles and aspnetuserroles)

connects app to the database
	-connects context class with database and services

-controllers
	-added authorizations based on user roles and changed names from last commit

-_Layout.cshtml
	-Changed the page so that only accesible pages are viewed. For example the developers page is now only accesible when you are logged in as a developer.

Other changes : commented email confirmation code in register.cshtml.cs(The app does not used this, the tutorial i used instructed me to comment the code).
